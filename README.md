# Titanic-Classfication

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person will survive the sinking of the Titanic based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, and gender.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
2. Download the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or any other reliable source.
3. Place the `titanic.csv` file in the same directory as the `titanic_classification.py` script.
4. Run the `titanic_classification.py` script using the following command:
   
## Project Overview

The project performs the following steps:

1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by dropping unnecessary columns, mapping categorical values, and filling missing values.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Build a RandomForestClassifier model.
5. Make predictions on the testing set.
6. Evaluate the model's accuracy and display a classification report.

## Conclusion

The RandomForestClassifier model is used to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The accuracy of the model and a detailed classification report are displayed after running the script.

Feel free to explore different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering to improve the model's performance.
